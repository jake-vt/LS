## Call by Sharing

1. Method arguments are scoped at the method level and are not avaialble outside of the method
2. The exception to (1) is when an action is performed on the argument that 'mutates the caller'
3. When an operation within the method mutates the caller, it will affect the original object
4. The only way to know which methods mutate the caller is by memorising them!
5. Ruby is neither pass-by-value or pass-by-reference - it is both!
This is sometimes known as pass-by-reference-of-the-value or call-by-sharing
6. When writing our own methods we can put an exclamation-mark/ bang (!) in the method name
This can be used to indicate that the method is 'destructive' (i.e. mutates the caller)

#### Example 1: Argument scope limited to method. Variable (a) cannot be reassigned from within the method

```ruby
def some_method(number)
  number = 7
end

a = 5
some_method(a)
puts a # This outputs '5' because calling the method on (a) did not reassign (a) outside of the method
```

#### Example 2: A method mutating the caller

```ruby
def mutate(array)
  array.pop
end

a = [1, 2, 3]

p a # This will output [1, 2, 3]

mutate(a) # This will return (3) from the method

p a # This will output [1, 2]
```

Even though (a) is outside of the scope of the mutate method it is still affected becuae the pop method
mutates the caller

#### Example 3: a method not mutating the caller but still returning the same value

```ruby
def no_mutate(array)
  array.last
end

a = [1, 2, 3]

p a # This will output [1, 2, 3]

no_mutate(a) # As with the mutate method this will return (3)

p a # This will still output [1, 2, 3] because the last method has not mutated the caller
```

#### Example 4: Using a bang! to indicate a method is destructive

```ruby
def destructive_method!(string) # Using a bang in the method name indicates that the method is destructive
  string.replace "Goodbye"
end

greeting = "Hello"

puts greeting # This will output 'Hello'

destructive_method!(greeting) # Calling the destructive_method! on greeting will mutate greeting

puts greeting # This will output 'Goodbye'
```
