# Puts vs Return

1. In Ruby, every method returns the evaluated result of the last line that is executed unless an explicit return comes before it
2. puts outputs the value of an object as a string to stdout

#### Example 1: printing value of variable and return value of method
```ruby
def some_method(string)
  string = "another string"
end

a = "some string"

puts a # => "some string" - this outputs the value of (a)
puts some_method(a) # => "another string" - this calls some_method() on (a) and outputs its return value
puts a # => "some string" - the method did not change the value of (a)
```

#### Example 2: mutating the caller and returning a value
```ruby
def mutate(array)
  array.pop
end

a = [1, 2, 3]

p a # => [1, 2, 3] - this is the value of (a)
p mutate(a) # => 3 - this is the return value of mutate() when called on (a)
p a # => [1, 2] - this is the value of (a) after mutate() has been called on it
```

#### Example 3: Return value is last line executed
```ruby
def conditional(value)
  if value > 5
    "Greater than five"
  else
    "Not greater than five"
  end
end

p conditional(9) # => "Greater than five" - this is the return value of conditional() since it is the last line executed

p conditional(4) # => "Not greater than five" - this is the return value of conditional() in this instance
```

#### Example 4: Explicit return
```ruby
def replace_string(string)
  return string = "another string"
  string.replace "a third string"
end

s = "some string"

p s # => "some string" - this is the value of (s)
p replace_string(s) # => "another string" - this is the return value of replace_string() since we used an explicit return
p s # => "some string" - the value of (s) has not changed since string.replace was not executed - return stopped method execution
```
