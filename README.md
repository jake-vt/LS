### **What is Launch School?**
 Launch School is an online school for software developers. Unlike traditional bootcamps, Launch School's pedagogy encourages mastery-based learning and places students on the 'slow path' towards building a career. In their own words: 

_"Our goal isn't to help you find a job, but help you launch a career. Our goal isn't to teach you to code, but to teach you how to deconstruct and problem solve like an engineer."_ 

### **What is the Core Curriculum?**
Launch School's Core Curriculum provides students with a flexible, 8-16 month-long programme (approx. 1500 hours) in full-stack development, primarily using Ruby, JS, HTML and CSS. A full breakdown of the curriculum's content can be found [**HERE**](https://launchschool.com/courses).
